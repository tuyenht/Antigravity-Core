$ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

This command activates BRAINSTORM mode for structured idea exploration. Use when you need to explore options before committing to an implementation.

---

## Behavior

When `/brainstorm` is triggered:

1. **Understand the goal**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who is the user?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Generate options**
   - Provide at least 3 different approaches
   - Each with pros and cons
   - Consider unconventional solutions

3. **Compare and recommend**
   - Summarize tradeoffs
   - Give a recommendation with reasoning
