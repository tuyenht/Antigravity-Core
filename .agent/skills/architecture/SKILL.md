# Architecture Decision Framework

> [!NOTE]
> **Consolidated:** This skill is part of `architecture-mastery`. For the full unified skill, see `@[skills/architecture-mastery]`.

> "Requirements drive architecture. Trade-offs inform decisions. ADRs capture rationale."

## Core Principle

**"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."**

- Start simple
- Add complexity ONLY when proven necessary
- You can always add patterns later
- Removing complexity is MUCH harder than adding it

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing architecture:

- [ ] Requirements clearly understood
- [ ] Constraints identified
- [ ] Each decision has trade-off analysis
- [ ] Simpler alternatives considered
- [ ] ADRs written for significant decisions
- [ ] Team expertise matches chosen patterns
