**Step 2: Generate Project Plan**

Create complete `docs/PLAN.md` following v5.0 `project-bootstrap.md` template:

1. **MVP SCOPE** (from Q1-5, Q6-12)
2. **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW** (from tech stack recommendation)
3. **DATABASE SCHEMA** (from Q9 data model)
4. **TECH DECISIONS** (from Step 1 recommendation, with WHY)
5. **CURRENT STATE & MATURITY** (N/A for new projects — mark as "Greenfield")
6. **TECHNICAL DEBT & RISKS** (from timeline, tech choices, integrations, security)
7. **MILESTONES & ROADMAP** (4 phases: Foundation → Core Features → Polish → Launch)

---

**Step 3: Getting Started Commands**

Provide copy-paste setup commands for the CHOSEN stack:

**Laravel + Inertia + React + TypeScript:**
```powershell
mkdir [project-name]
cd [project-name]
agi                                    # Install Antigravity-Core (requires global setup)
composer create-project laravel/laravel .
composer require inertiajs/inertia-laravel
npm install react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom @vitejs/plugin-react typescript
npm install -D @inertiajs/react
.\.agent\scripts\health-check.ps1
```

**Next.js + TypeScript:**
```powershell
mkdir [project-name]
cd [project-name]
agi                                    # Install Antigravity-Core (requires global setup)
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir
.\.agent\scripts\health-check.ps1
```

**Django + React:**
```powershell
mkdir [project-name]
cd [project-name]
agi                                    # Install Antigravity-Core (requires global setup)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers
django-admin startproject core .
.\.agent\scripts\health-check.ps1
```

**React Native (Expo):**
```powershell
mkdir [project-name]
cd [project-name]
agi                                    # Install Antigravity-Core (requires global setup)
npx create-expo-app@latest . --template blank-typescript
.\.agent\scripts\health-check.ps1
```

**Note:** If `agi` command not available, run global setup first:
```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuyenht/Antigravity-Core/main/.agent/scripts/install-global.ps1" | iex
```
