cd [project-name]
agi                                    # Install Antigravity-Core (requires global setup)
composer create-project laravel/laravel .
composer require inertiajs/inertia-laravel
npm install react react-dom @vitejs/plugin-react
.\.agent\scripts\health-check.ps1
```

**Next.js:**
```powershell
mkdir [project-name]
cd [project-name]
agi                                    # Install Antigravity-Core (requires global setup)
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app
.\.agent\scripts\health-check.ps1

**Note:** If `agi` command not available, run global setup first:
