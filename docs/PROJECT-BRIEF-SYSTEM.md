## 🎯 WHICH PROMPT TO USE?

### **Scenario A: I have existing code**

✅ **Use:** `Analyze-Existing-Project-Prompt.txt`

**What it does:**
- Analyzes 50+ file types
- 17 analysis categories
- Reads routes, controllers, models, migrations
- Analyzes frontend (React/Vue/Next.js)
- Scans config files, .env.example
- Git history analysis
- Performance profiling (N+1 queries, missing indexes)
- Security audit (vulnerabilities, outdated packages)

**Generates:**
1. `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` (9 sections, 100% filled)
2. `PROJECT-CONVENTIONS.md` (patterns found)
3. `PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION-RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (actionable fixes)

**Time:** 15-20 minutes (automatic analysis)  
**Score:** 98/100 completeness

---

### **Scenario B: Starting new project**

✅ **Use:** `New-Project-Interview-Prompt.txt`

**What it does:**
- 21-question interactive interview
- 5 categories (Business, Technical, Scale, Infrastructure, Future)
- Recommends tech stack (compares 2-3 options)
- Justifies recommendations based on YOUR answers

**Generates:**
1. `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` (9 sections from your answers)
2. `TECH-STACK-ANALYSIS.md` (detailed comparison)
3. `GETTING-STARTED.md` (copy-paste setup commands)

**Time:** 30-45 minutes (Q&A + generation)  
**Score:** 100% tailored to your needs

- [ ] Features SPECIFIC (not vague "user management")
- [ ] Timeline REALISTIC (based on scope + team)
- [ ] Risks IDENTIFIED (not "None")
- [ ] Metrics MEASURABLE (not "Make it good")
- [ ] Approval section ready for sign-off

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

**For Existing Projects:**
- Ensure project path is accessible
- Analysis is read-only (safe to run)
- Review generated CONVENTIONS carefully (project-specific)
- Apply PERFORMANCE recommendations incrementally

**For New Projects:**
- Answer ALL 21 questions (don't skip)
- Be realistic about timeline & budget
- Tech stack recommendation is based on YOUR answers
- GETTING-STARTED commands are copy-paste ready

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** "Analysis incomplete"
- Solution: Check file paths, ensure all directories accessible

**Problem:** "Interview questions unclear"
- Solution: Ask Antigravity for clarification, provide examples

**Problem:** "Tech stack recommendation doesn't fit"
- Solution: Provide more details in answers, mention constraints upfront

**Problem:** "PROJECT BRIEF has placeholders"
- Solution: Rerun prompt with more specific project path/answers

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You know you're ready when:**

- ✅ PROJECT-BRIEF.md is 100% filled (no [TODO])
- ✅ All 9 sections have actual data (not estimates)
- ✅ Tech stack versions are EXACT
